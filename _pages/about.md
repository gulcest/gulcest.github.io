Hi! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ I'm Sem. 

I'm passionate about designing democratic ways for online communities to create and distribute economic value, and am always looking forward to meeting people that want to make the world a fairer and more inclusive place! 

You can find traces of my worldly presence put together on this website, including my CV, publications and blog posts. 

Miscellaneously, I also post things that move and inspire me. I love to make music (play the violin, the ukulele, sing and produce electronic music), read and watch cinematic treasures.
