Hi! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ I'm Sem. 

I enjoy designing organizations, researching communities and am currently in the process of applying to interesting PhD programs across North America. I'm passionate about designing democratic ways to how online communities that create and distribute economic value and am always looking forward to meeting people that want to make the world a fairer and more inclusive place! 

You can find traces of my worldly presence put together on this website, including my CV, publications and blog posts. 

Miscellaneously, I also post things that move and inspire me. I love to make music (play the violin, the ukulele, sing and produce electronic music), read and watch cinematic treasures.
