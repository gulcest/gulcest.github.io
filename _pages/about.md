Hi! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:・ﾟ✧ 

I'm Sem. I'm curious about finding new ways to utilize our collective powers. 

You can find traces of my worldly presence put together on this website, including my CV, publications and blog posts. 

Miscellaneously, I also post things that move and inspire me. I love to make music (play the violin, the ukulele, sing and produce electronic music), read and watch cinematic treasures. 

I am always looking forward to meeting people that want to make the world a fairer and more inclusive place! If you think we'd collaborate well together, reach out to me at: turansemragulce [at] gmail [dot] com.
