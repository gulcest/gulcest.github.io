## Literature

I document most of my readings on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5847620-semra-g-lce-turan).

### Some of my favourite quotes from some of my favourite writers

"<i>Life can't be all that bad,</i> I'd think from time to time. <i>Whatever happens, I can always take a long walk along the Bosphorus</i>." ---<cite>Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul: Memories and the City</cite>

"Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder <q>why, why, why?'</q>; Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land; Man got to tell himself he understand." ---<cite>Kurt Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle</cite>

"Perhaps we become aware of our age only at exceptional moments and most of the time we are ageless." ---<cite>Milan Kundera, Immortality</cite>

"It may be normal, darling; but I'd rather be natural." ---<cite>Truman Capote, Breakfast at Tiffany's and Three Stories</cite>

## Cinema 

I document most of the films I watch on [Mubi](https://mubi.com/users/1337322) and am always sketching ideas for my next short movie. You view my short film-ography on my [Vimeo profile](https://vimeo.com/user4025971).

## Photography 

Below is a selection of the photos I took. I mainly use Canon AE-1, Nikon D-90, Fisheye No. 2 and Diana F+. [My Flickr profile](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gulcest/) is unfortunately not complete.
