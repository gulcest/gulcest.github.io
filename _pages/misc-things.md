## Literature

I document most of my readings on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5847620-semra-g-lce-turan).

#### Some of my favourite quotes and writers

“Life can't be all that bad,' I'd think from time to time. <q>Whatever happens, I can always take a long walk along the Bosphorus</q>.” ― Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul: Memories and the City

“Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder <q>why, why, why?'</q>; Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land; Man got to tell himself he understand.” - Kurt Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle
