## Literature

I document most of my readings on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5847620-semra-g-lce-turan).

### Some of my favourite quotes from some of my favourite writers

> Life can't be all that bad,' I'd think from time to time. <q>Whatever happens, I can always take a long walk along the Bosphorus</q>.
― <i>Orhan Pamuk, Istanbul: Memories and the City</i>

“Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder <q>why, why, why?'</q>; Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land; Man got to tell himself he understand.” --- <cite>Kurt Vonnegut, Cat's Cradle</cite>
