👩‍🍳 What if there was a more <b>natural way</b> to cook with internet friends from your own kitchen? 

↔️ For a client in home appliances, two visual designer friends and I developed a concept enabling more organic connections from users’ own kitchen areas.

ℹ️ wecook is a set of <b>kitchen enhancement</b> hardware, as well as a software that allows for natural movement in the kitchen while connecting and cooking with others. The base hardware is a smart kitchen rail that’s attached to the wall overlooking the counters. On it are designated, customizable areas of water-proof surface charging to attach mobile phones, tablets as well as additional speakers and cameras.
