🧑🏻‍🤝‍🧑🏿 I facilitated an <b>Ideation Workshop</b> (structurally resembling the [Future Workshop](https://participedia.net/method/4796) where participants re-imagined shared workspaces. <b>If the current state of technology, budgetary constraints or further implementation barriers didn’t apply, what tools would make their experience of working in shared spaces easier?</b>

<br/>🎤 Participants (all regularly work shared spaces, 4 designers -2 interaction, 2 industrial-, 4 knowledge workers in corporate, 2 psychologists and 1 architect) individually worked to create their own, sometimes reality-bending, concepts. Later, they briefly presented their ideas and cast their vote for <b>top 3 most liked concepts</b>.

<br/>❤ The most liked concept of the workshop proved to be the <b><i>Orange Elephant</i>: An object with shared meaning, which signals the individual’s need for uninterrupted focus time when put on desk</b>.

<br/>🧠 Starting off with this idea, we built <b><i>calmworklight</i></b>, a desktop lamp that responds to changes in peoples’ focus strength, using the commercially available [NeuroSky MindWave](https://store.neurosky.com/pages/mindwave).

<br/>ℹ️ The lamp’s expression depends solely on the <b>user’s level of focus</b>. If it is strong, the lamp returns a steady, calming warm light. If not, the light emission follows a breathing pattern, aiming to encourage the user to be more mindful of their breath. 

📝 While we didn’t pursue calmworklight’s extended production, initial user studies found it useful in shared workspaces. The research and implementation is documented in more detail in our Designing Interactive Systems [conference publication](http://gulcest.github.io/files/turan-2019.pdf).
