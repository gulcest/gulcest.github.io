üí∏ During my time at iyzico, I worked with developer and designer teams to experiment with different payment products for <b>small-and-medium-sized businesses</b>. The main intention behind all these products was to make it <b>easier</b> for these businesses to process online payments by having them easily integrate the features to their websites and dashboards.

<br/> 1Ô∏è‚É£ With the [Mass Payouts](https://dev.iyzipay.com/en/mass-payouts) product, businesses could send multiple payments at once by uploading a CSV file to the dashboard.

<br/> 2Ô∏è‚É£ With the [Refund to Balance](https://dev.iyzipay.com/en/iyzico-hesabina-iade) product, businesses could instantly refund to their customers, without the need to wait for the banks to process things.

<br/> 3Ô∏è‚É£ With the [Settlement to Balance](https://dev.iyzipay.com/en/iyzico-hesabina-para-transferi) product, businesses could instantly get their receivables from marketplaces into their balances, again, without the need to wait for the banks to process things.
