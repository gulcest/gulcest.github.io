👩‍💻 As part of a wider [research project](https://happern.ku.edu.tr/projects-2/eventmap/) at the Happern Interactive Information Design Lab at Koc University in Istanbul, I helped the team build up a prototype version to be used in user interviews. 

<br/> 👥 I utilized open source projects and platforms (including OpenStreetMap, Snazzy Info Windows) to visualize the multiple data layers on the web-based map (including weather, crowdedness, traffic and events happening in the neighborhood). You may browse the usage flow with the various data layers [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1stkAogTNAbCWM0rd0XgLEmE_a5898Vaq).

<br/> ➡️ The project continued with further iterations, user interviews and [research papers](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-40406-6_12).
