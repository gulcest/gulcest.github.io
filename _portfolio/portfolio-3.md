📱 For a Germany-based multinational in kitchen appliances production, we designed and developed the first version of an iOS application-controlled system that lets users maintain their fridge easily. This design was showcased at a public outing demonstrating the future of kitchen appliances, and was tried out with commercial cruise ships.

<br/>🛒 With the application, users can <b>scan their food</b> as they go into the fridge or the freezer. For the first version, we used QR codes to make things a bit easier. The scanning may also be made with the barcode in later iterations. 

<br/>🧊 With commercial use cases in mind, we included an object movement control feature that lets the application tell whenever a scannable item is near the fridge. This lets the application remind you to <b>'check-in' what you've just bought</b>. This feature can also be advanced so that the app directly recognizes what has just been brought to the fridge's vicinity.

<br/>🍎 Users can set triggered actions: When e.g. your stock of apples is low, if allowed, <b>your fridge can order apples from the nearby supermarket</b>. We had a test-try of this feature with a nearby supermarket, connecting to their stock database.
