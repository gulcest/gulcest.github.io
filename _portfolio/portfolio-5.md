👩‍💻 Using MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js and Node.js), we built a website on which users can both create and take part in projects with a <b>social mission</b>, such as building schools in unpriviledged areas of the world. 

<br/> 🎗 Our idea got offered financial and networking support from the Chair Software Engineering for Business Information Systems (sebis) at TUM and was developed further to be placed within the student web infranet.
