🌍 Born from the desire to nurture a different kind of digital infrastructure, DeCoCo is a collective dedicated to decolonial ways of being and cooperative experimentation online.

<br/> ✨ Through organizing, research, and toolmaking, we support those building commons-based alternatives—where dignity, care, and collective value come first.

<br/> We'll place a call for supporting and founding members soon. Sign up for our zine [here](https://decoco.online/)!
