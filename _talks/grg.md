*Progressive decentralization is a core objective of the Nexus Mutual team. But what does it mean to progressively decentralize?*
<br>
<br>
We believe thereâ€™s great value in studying the history of *cooperatives, commons management, and online collaboration*. These foundations help us build the theoretical grounding needed to navigate decentralized governance.
<br>
<br>
The Governance Reading Group is open to anyone passionate about self-governance. We meet online every two weeks to discuss 30â€“40 pages of a collaboratively selected book or paper.
<br>
<br>
You can find some of our past reading lists on the [Nexus Mutual Forum](https://forum.nexusmutual.io/c/community/governance-reading-group/49).
