In an attempt to lower the learning barriers towards mastering Unity, the social initiative [Kodluyoruz.org](https://www.kodluyoruz.org/gamebootcamp/) is organizing another volunteer initiative to translate the official Unity docs to Turkish. 

If you know Turkish and English, and want to help, please let me or [one of the Kodluyoruz team members](https://www.kodluyoruz.org/about) know!
