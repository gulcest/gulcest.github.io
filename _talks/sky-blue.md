I'm excited to be accepted to this year's cohort of the [Sky Blue programme](https://commonpurpose.org/) designed by the leadership development organization Common Purpose. 

This program will bring together a dynamic group of leaders from around the world, from many different fields, who have a common focus â€“ our environment. <q>The objective is to equip the participants with the cross-boundary leadership skills and broader networks to increase their impact, and a community of practice that enables the exchange of experience, ideas and strategies with their peers</q>.
