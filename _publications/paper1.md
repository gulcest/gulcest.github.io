## Abstract
While working, we are not always in line with our ability to focus. Being more mindful of own cognitive abilities, including the ability to focus, may contribute to a more pleasant work experience. This paper presents calmworklight, an initial design proposal for dealing with this issue. calmworklight is a desktop lamp that responds to changes in peoples' focus strength as captured by a commercially available EEG device. The lamp's expression depends solely on the user's level of focus. If it is strong, the lamp returns a steady, calming warm light. If not, the light emission follows a breathing pattern, aiming to encourage the user to be more mindful of their breath and to cultivate a meditative focus. We conducted 3 user studies to get a better understanding of calmworklight's usage and benefits. The most striking outcome of the study is the worker's need for a regulating system that helps them plan when to socialize and when to focus, which should be considered for future workplace designs.
